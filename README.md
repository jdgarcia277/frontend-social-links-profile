## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used Grid for the card layout and focused on accessibility in my HTML. Although I mainly use flexbox, I wanted to practice more with Grid, another major layout style.

### Continued development

I plan to continue practicing with CSS Grid to enhance my layout skills and am committed to making further improvements in accessibility to ensure an inclusive user experience.
